# DraculasCastle

First Hackathon for School of Code!

This was our hackathon project after the first week of Soc where we had to plan and then make an escape room game within scratch.

This was a brilliant first go as it stopped us getting overwhelmed by the real coding and allowed us to focus on things such as pair programming, time managemnt, team communication and collaberation as well as some of the industry standards. Following the planning and creating, we also had to present our project and discuss the planning phases and reasoning behind our choices, giving us some real experience is presenting under time constraints.

Really Appreciative of my team mates Hope Pichur and Jermaine Jack for their proffesionalism and general pleasentness to work with. We communicated really well and its been a pleasure working with them for the first week, my next group has some really big shoes to fill!

"Build an Escape Room using Scratch
That's right, you'll be brainstorming, planning, and building an escape room in Scratch. All the details are in the GitHub team challenge repo you'll find at the bottom of this page.

Despite being in Scratch, we want you to use the proper project flow you've learned so far. Namely collaborating through git and GitHub. Make sure you understand what that means by talking it through with your teammates.
Presentations
Prepare to talk us through your progress and what you’ve built, you’ll have 6 minutes to present.

Example guideline time estimates (6 minutes limit):

30 seconds to introduce your team members
~1 minute for your reflections on how you worked as a team, what in your project went well, and what you’d improve/change for next time
~1 minute to talk through your flow diagram and your reflections on it
~3 minutes to demo your final product

Present for impact! You're in a new company, and this is your chance to show what you've learned, how you've progressed, and what the key parts of your work are. On Friday morning we will run a presentation skills session to introduce a specific aspect of presenting that may help.

Have fun!
Planning
The aim is to use all of the concepts we've visited this week to make the most out of this challenge. Success is not hacking together a great project. Success is working as a high-performance tech team would, using Computational Thinking and learning efficiently to create a great project and a better team.

The first stage of School of Code's approach to computational thinking is to understand the problem. In terms of this challenge, that means exploring the options and articulating clearly what we want to build.

In order to explore the possibilities effectively in your team, we're recommending using Disney Ideation. It's a great way to get an ambitious but solid idea together. See the next activity for more information.

Once you have a direction, you want to use an Agile approach to execute. That means planning your path to your vision through milestones representing Minimum Viable Products (MVPs). The key part is each MVP should deliver some value, so that if all else fails you can demonstrate something working.

Planning should happen in GitHub via Issues and Milestones - decide as a team how best to approach this. Each issue should have a Definition of Done (DoD) - this means in the issue should be described how you as a team can check off the issue as complete. For example, if we were creating a To Do List application, we might have an issue to complete to "Create a todo" and it could have the DoD as follows:

 • Criteria 1: Users can enter a task name in the input field.
 • Criteria 2: The task is added to the list when the user clicks the “Add” button.
 • Criteria 3: The task appears at the top of the list.
 • Criteria 4: Users receive a confirmation message saying “Task added.”
 • Criteria 5: The input field is cleared after adding the task."
