First Hackathon for School of Code!

This was our hackathon project after the first week of Soc where we had to plan and then make an escape room game within scratch.

This was a brilliant first go as it stopped us getting overwhelmed by the real coding and allowed us to focus on things such as pair programming, time managemnt, team communication and collaberation as well as some of the industry standards. Following the planning and creating, we also had to present our project and discuss the planning phases and reasoning behind our choices, giving us some real experience is presenting under time constraints.

Really Appreciative of my team mates Hope Pichur and Jermaine Jack for their proffesionalism and general pleasentness to work with. We communicated really well and its been a pleasure working with them for the first week, my next group has some really big shoes to fill!

_Build an Escape Room using Scratch_
_That's right, you'll be brainstorming, planning, and building an escape room in Scratch. All the details are in the GitHub team challenge repo you'll find at the bottom of this page._

_Despite being in Scratch, we want you to use the proper project flow you've learned so far. Namely collaborating through git and GitHub. Make sure you understand what that means by talking it through with your teammates._
_Presentations_
_Prepare to talk us through your progress and what you’ve built, you’ll have 6 minutes to present._

_Example guideline time estimates (6 minutes limit):_

_30 seconds to introduce your team members_
_~1 minute for your reflections on how you worked as a team, what in your project went well, and what you’d improve/change for next time_
_~1 minute to talk through your flow diagram and your reflections on it_
_~3 minutes to demo your final product_

_Present for impact! You're in a new company, and this is your chance to show what you've learned, how you've progressed, and what the key parts of your work are. On Friday morning we will run a presentation skills session to introduce a specific aspect of presenting that may help._

_Have fun!_
